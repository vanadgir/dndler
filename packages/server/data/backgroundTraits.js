You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.",

While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazar`dou`s and you remain in good standing with your temple."
